install nginx:
    brew install nginx (for Mac)
    post installation nginx location: /opt/homebrew/opt/nginx/bin/nginx (for Mac M2)
    post installation nginx conf file: /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf (for Mac M2)
    conf file sample added in this folder
nginx with brew (for Mac):
    start: brew services start nginx
    stop: brew services stop nginx
    re-start: brew services restart nginx
    list all: brew services list
nginx logs:
    /opt/homebrew/var/log/nginx/access.log
    /opt/homebrew/var/log/nginx/error.log

hosts file:
    location (in Mac): /etc/hosts
    sample hosts file added in this folder

For forward proxy, this is what you will need to add:
    in the hosts file (at location /etc/hosts in mac M2):
        127.0.0.1   mykubeapi
    in nginx file (at location /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf in mac M2):
        server {
                listen       80;
                server_name  mykubeapi;
                location / {
                            proxy_pass http://localhost:8081;
                            proxy_set_header Host $host;
                            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                           }
                }
    Now access url without port and with your domain name:
        http://mykubeapi/greeting
